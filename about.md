## About Me
<img class=prof_pic src="../img/screenshot.png" title="NFC Bikelock">


I am a computer engineering student at Texas A&M University. I have always wanted to become an engineer, but I was not always certain on which type I wanted to be. In 4th grade I wanted to be a civil engineer. As I grew up, however, I started utilizing technology more and more. I eventually realized that it would be a shame if I did not learn how to use something so ubiquitous to its full potential.<br>
<br>
I am particularly interested in controls and automation. As someone who has always attempted to have some semblance of control over my life, I feel like the field suits me well. I find the mathematical applications within the field to be interesting, and I cannot wait to learn more about the field and to gain experience in it.<br>
