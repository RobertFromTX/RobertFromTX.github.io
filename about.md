## About Me
I am a computer engineering student at Texas A&M University. I have always wanted to become an engineer, but I was not always set on becoming a computer engineer. In 4th grade I wanted to be a civil engineer. As I grew up, I started utilizing technology more and more. As a result, I decided that civil would not be the best option for me.<br>
<br>
I am particularly interested in controls and automation. As someone who has always attempted to have some semblance of control over my life, I feel like the field suits me well. I find the mathematical applications within the field to be interesting. I cannot wait to learn more about the field and to gain experience in it.<br>
